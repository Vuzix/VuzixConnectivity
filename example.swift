/*
  This is a very simple example of how to use the connectivity framework for Vuzix smart glasses.
  This example is a basic chat app that can send text input to the glasses.  If glasses respond we can capture that text and display in our UITextView.
  Requires a UIViewController containing a UITextField for input, UITextView for reading, and
  a UIButton for sending the input.
  Also would need an Android app that responds to the intents running on the glasses, using the Android Connectivity lib (see https://www.vuzix.com/Developer/KnowledgeBase/Detail/1098)
